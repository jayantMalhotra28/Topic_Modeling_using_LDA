# Topic_Modeling_using_LDA

Engineered an end to end ML pipeline, leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, enhanced with word embedding for semantic feature extraction on 20,000 text documents without labeled data

Employed various encoding schemes, including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec to pre-process and vectorize the corpus. Utilized metrics such as coherence score and perplexity for evaluating effectiveness
